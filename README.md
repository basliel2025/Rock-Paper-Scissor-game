# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built for simplicity, fun, and a bit of friendly competition. This project is a lightweight implementation designed to showcase basic game logic, user interaction, and clean code structure.

## What It Does

This game lets a user play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly selects a move, and the game determines the winner based on standard rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Why It Exists

This project was built to explore core JavaScript functionality such as:
- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- Modular script structure  
- Random number generation  

## How To Run It

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/basliel2025/Rock-Paper-Scissor-game.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder  
   `cd Rock-Paper-Scissor-game`

3. Open the game in your browser

## Project Structure

- `Game.html`: Provides the basic HTML structure and loads the external script  
- `Game.js`: Contains all game logic and browser interaction  
- `README.md`: Explains the purpose and usage of the project
